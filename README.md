## Intro

This is a generic mailform script written in [PHP](http://www.php.net) and based on [Swift Mailer](http://swiftmailer.org/). There is a standard **index.html** file that represents the input form. This form can be customized to your needs.

The actual processing happens in **form.php** and uses **config.php** for basic configuration parameters and **HTTP GET & POST** parameters for the various e-mail headers.
